## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Software Engineer** and **Master’s student in Computer Engineering** at **San José State University**, passionate about building production-grade systems that bridge the gap between scalable backend architectures and Artificial Intelligence.

My experience ranges from **warehouse automation** to **geospatial ML** and **document intelligence**. I specialize in creating clean APIs, optimizing data pipelines, and integrating **Generative AI (RAG)** into scalable workflows. I have a strong focus on reliability, testability, and measurable impact.

## 🔬 Research

**“An Experimentation for generating Text-based Medical Report from Chest X-Ray images using Attention based Deep Learning Models”**
*DOI: [10.1016/j.procs.2025.04.299](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2025.04.299)*

*   **Led research on medical report generation** by designing and evaluating 4 encoder–decoder architectures (baseline, attention, spatial attention, BiGRU), achieving BLEU score improvements from 0.619 to 0.745 (**+20.4% gain**).
*   **Engineered the model stack** using **CheXNet (DenseNet-121)** as the image encoder and LSTM/GRU/BiGRU variants as decoders with GloVe 300-d embeddings; integrated spatial attention to enhance visual–textual alignment.
*   **Applied beam search** and generative modeling techniques to improve clinical text fluency; benchmarked trade-offs between output quality and latency (1.0s → 5.06s).

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Autonomous Vision — Real-Time Stereo Depth & 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/JNR-10)
*Technologies: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CUDA, Core ML, Open3D*
* Implemented and benchmarked **8 state-of-the-art stereo-matching CNNs** on the KITTI dataset.
* Optimized inference with **CUDA acceleration** and mixed-precision, achieving **<100ms latency** for real-time 3D perception.
* Integrated **YOLOv8** for object detection combined with depth estimation for 3D spatial awareness.

### PDF Q&A with LangChain + FAISS
*Technologies: LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI Embeddings, Python*
*   Built an end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that ingests PDFs, chunks text, embeds it, and answers natural-language questions.
*   Implemented robust PDF loading and text normalization; chunked documents into ~800-char windows with overlap to control context drift.
*   Generated embeddings and indexed 149 chunks in **FAISS** for sub-second similarity search.
*   **Impact:** Reduced ad-hoc PDF lookup from minutes to seconds, establishing a reproducible pipeline with measurable retrieval latency.
